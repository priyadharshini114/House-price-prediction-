# House Price Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project contains various features such as number of rooms, crime rate, and proximity to employment centers. The goal is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates house prices based on these features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Boston Housing Dataset, which is commonly used for regression tasks. It consists of 506 samples with 13 features each, including both numerical and categorical variables. The target variable is the median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s.

## Techniques Used
- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the distribution of features and their relationship with the target variable.
- Model Building: Training various regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

## Files
- `house_price_detection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis and code.
